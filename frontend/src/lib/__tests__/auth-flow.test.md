# Authentication Flow Testing Strategy

## Unit Tests

### API Client Tests
- [ ] Login with valid credentials sets httpOnly cookie
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials throws appropriate error
- [ ] Logout clears httpOnly cookie
- [ ] Request timeout handling
- [ ] CSRF header inclusion on all requests
- [ ] Error handling for 401/403 responses

### Auth Context Tests
- [ ] Initial authentication check on mount
- [ ] User state updates on successful login
- [ ] User state clears on logout
- [ ] Loading states during auth operations
- [ ] Proper error propagation to UI components

## Integration Tests

### Login Flow
- [ ] User can login with valid credentials
- [ ] Authentication persists across page refreshes
- [ ] Invalid credentials show appropriate error
- [ ] Network errors are handled gracefully

### Logout Flow
- [ ] User can logout successfully
- [ ] Logout clears all authentication state
- [ ] Logout redirects to login page
- [ ] Failed logout still clears local state

### Protected Routes
- [ ] Unauthenticated users redirect to login
- [ ] Authenticated users can access protected content
- [ ] Authentication check doesn't cause infinite redirects
- [ ] Proper loading states during auth verification

## Security Tests

### XSS Protection
- [ ] JWT tokens not accessible via JavaScript
- [ ] localStorage/sessionStorage remain empty of tokens
- [ ] httpOnly cookies properly set and transmitted

### CSRF Protection
- [ ] X-Requested-With header present on all auth requests
- [ ] Requests fail without proper CSRF headers
- [ ] SameSite cookie attributes properly configured

## Performance Tests

### Authentication Speed
- [ ] Initial auth check completes within 500ms
- [ ] Login flow completes within 2 seconds
- [ ] No unnecessary re-renders during auth state changes

### Memory Usage
- [ ] No memory leaks from auth context
- [ ] Proper cleanup of event listeners and timers
- [ ] Request cancellation works correctly

## Manual Testing Checklist

### Happy Path
- [ ] Login with demo credentials
- [ ] Navigate protected routes
- [ ] Refresh page maintains authentication
- [ ] Logout and verify redirection

### Error Scenarios
- [ ] Network disconnection during login
- [ ] Server returns 500 error
- [ ] Invalid JWT token scenarios
- [ ] Session expiry handling

### Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)  
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)
- [ ] Mobile Safari
- [ ] Mobile Chrome

### Security Scenarios
- [ ] Attempt XSS via developer tools
- [ ] Verify httpOnly cookie flags
- [ ] Check HTTPS-only cookies in production
- [ ] Validate CORS configuration
